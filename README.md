# Advent-of-Code
This repository will hold my Advent of Code solutions.
Note that sometimes I am just writing code that works and it can be quite messy or hard to follow.
Some days have both Part 1 and Part 2 answers printed, while some may need a little modification of the code. And some outright doesn't have some Parts because I was too lazy.
